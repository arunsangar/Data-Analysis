# Data Analysis
**CPSC 483 - Introduction to Machine Learning**
**Project 3 - Bank Data Analysis**

### **Problem description:**

Analyze a banking data set to predict if a client has subscribed a term deposit (binary yes/no). Compare the results of different classifiers.

### **Goals:**
1. Practice using guassian naive bayes, logistic regression and support vector machines
2. Compare the difference between the classifiers
3. Check any assumptions made from the dataset

### **How it works:**

This analysis preprocesses the dataset's features into ordinal, categorical and numerical features. The numerical features are scaled to normalize the range. It then performs guassian naive bayes, logistic regression and support vector machine analysis on the data. ROC curves are graphed in order to compare the results from each. The assumptiion tests how well a classifier will do if it simply predicted 0.

### **Running the program:**

This analysis utilizes a Jupyter notebook to showcase the executable code as well as the resulting graphs. Download and add the dataset to the notebook to run the analysis.
